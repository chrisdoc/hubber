Hubber is a pet project that aims to develop a Github client that allows to search for users and repositories. At the moment Hubber is using Githubs RESTful API but in the future the project will move over to the recently announced [GraphQL API](http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/).

Hubber is developed using TDD and uses Travis-CI for continuous integration and Codecov for code coverage.
